abstract={Mosquito-borne diseases negatively affect economically emerging countries. Nevertheless, the current public healthcare solutions are insufficient to support disease surveillance and control. The citizen engagement in reporting mosquito breeding sites is hard to achieve but essential in preventing disease outbreaks. This paper introduces the VazaZika platform aimed to support the surveillance and control of mosquito-borne diseases. This platform evolves the VazaDengue legacy platform with gamification. Through game elements and rules, we aim to make enjoyable and challenging to report mosquito breeding sites via VazaZika. Citizens are continuously rewarded as they perform tasks in the platform. They progress in levels that enable new tasks and jump in rankings according to the citizens' location. Citizens can also join teams for engaging with challenges, which helps to develop a sense of belonging and connection against the spread of diseases. This paper reports the process of gamifying VazaDengue, the platform user interface and its conceptual model, aimed to support reuse.},

abstract={Code refactoring is widely practiced by software developers. There is an explicit assumption that code refactoring improves the structural quality of a software project, thereby also reducing its bug proneness. However, refactoring is often applied with different purposes in practice. Depending on the complexity of certain refactorings, developers might unconsciously make the source code more susceptible to have bugs. In this paper, we present a longitudinal study of 5 Java open source projects, where 20,689 refactorings, and 1,033 bug reports were analyzed. We found that many bugs are introduced in the refactored code as soon as the first immediate change is made on it. Furthermore, code elements affected by refactorings performed in conjunction with other changes are more prone to have bugs than those affected by pure refactorings.},

abstract = "Dengue is a disease transmitted by the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which also transmits the Zika virus and Chikungunya. Unfortunately, the population of different countries has been suffering from the diseases transmitted by this mosquito. The communities should play an important role in combating and preventing the mosquito-borne diseases. However, due to the limited engagement of the population, new solutions need to be used to strengthen the mosquito surveillance. VazaDengue is one of these solutions, which offers the users a web and mobile platform for preventing and combating mosquito-borne diseases. The system relies on social actions of citizens reporting mosquito breeding sites and dengue cases, in which the reports are made available to the community and health agencies. In order to address the limited population engagement, the system proactively monitors social media network as Twitter to enrich the information provided by the system. It processes the natural language text from the network to classify the tweets according to a set of predefined categories. After the classification, the relevant tweets are provided to the users as reports. In this paper, we describe the VazaDengue features including its ability to harvest and classify tweets. Since the VazaDengue system aims to strengthen the entomological surveillance of the mosquito that transmits Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya by providing geolocated reports, we present here two studies to evaluate its potential contributions. The first evaluation uses a survey conducted in the Brazilian community of health agents. The goal is to evaluate the relevance of the classified tweets according to the health agents’ perspective. The second study compares the official reports of the 2015–2016 epidemic waves in Brazil with the concentration of mosquito-related tweets found by VazaDengue. The goal is to verify if the concentration of tweets can be used for monitoring the mosquito manifestation in big cities. The results of these two evaluations are encouraging. For instance, we have found that the health agents tend to agree with the relevance of the classified tweets. Moreover, the concentration of tweets is likely to be effective for monitoring big cities. The results of these evaluations are helping us to improve the VazaDengue system further. These improvements will make the VazaDengue system even more useful for combating and preventing the mosquito-borne diseases."

  abstract={In component-based software product lines (SPL), each component has to encapsulate features, restrict data access, and be replaceable. For critical components, with multiple features and dependencies, these criteria are fundamental for flexible product configuration. Previous work assume that coupling metrics help characterize critical components, but we lack empirical evidence for that assumption. By characterizing critical components, we could help developers identify components that require careful maintenance and evolution. This paper relies on five well-known coupling metrics to compose a strategy for characterizing critical components in component-based SPLs. Our results suggest reasonable strategy’s accuracy but the need for using additional metrics.},

abstract="In Software Product Lines (SPLs), the modeling of non-functional properties (NFPs) and context adaptation scenarios are important activities, once they make possible the identification of interdependencies constraints between functional requirements (FR) and NFP, according to a specific adaptation context scenario. However, there are few tools to help domain engineers to represent NFPs and context adaptation scenarios. To deal with this problem, we propose DyMMer-NFP, an extension of the DyMMer tool to support the modeling of NFPs and multiple contextual adaptation scenarios in feature models. DyMMer-NFP uses a catalog with 39 NFPs. Each NFP in this catalog were mapped according to each quality characteristic and sub-characteristics presented in the ISO/IEC 25010 SQuaRE product quality model. To specify the interdependencies between NFPs and features, DyMMer-NFP has used the concept of contribution links. In order to make it easier to evaluate DyMMer-NFP two datasets, called AFFOgaTO and ESPREssO, were made available for free.",
